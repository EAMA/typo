Feature: When mergeing two articles (and thus deleting at least one of them), the permalinks to the original articles should point to the merged article

  I should be able to go to the merged article when click on the permalinks
  so I could read the merged article

Scenario: one of the articles should be deleted
Scenario: permalink of the remaining article should points to itself
Scenario: permalink of the deleted article should points to the merged article
